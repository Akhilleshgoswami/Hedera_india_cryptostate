# CryptoState 
## We Build  Trust 🤓💪🏻
## [Demo](https://youtu.be/NhazzFAE4Zw) this demo uses web3 and blockchain we just want to show, if  we would  get success to  deploy our smart contract on Hedera node then this how it will going to work .

# What is this all about? 👀
* This is a Blockchain-based project that solves many problems of the current Real state system and makes it more secure and makes buying and selling property easy.It is based on the concept of the Non-Fungible Token Marketplace and treat the property as NFT and Uses ERC721 Token to build its all functionality. 
* This project is under Hedera india Hackthon


# What's the issue we are trying to solve? 👈
* nowadays There are a lot of fraud going on in the current real state system such as tempring with the property,selling single property to two or more persons, in India, when we buy or sell the property we use paperwork what if the paper lost, what if someone temper with  that paper what is someone modified that paper, in this condition we don't have any proof that this property belongs to us.


# Local development setup
* clone the git repositories
* npm i
* install truffle 
* install metamask
* Create a test-net on metamask import first account from the ganache-cli 
* install ganache 
* run ganache-cli 
* run truffle migrate --reset 
* You are ready to go 



# Technologies we used 👩🏻‍💻
* Ganache-cli
* truffle
* Metamask
* Web3
* IPFS
* Solidity
* Ethereum test   Blockchain
* Hedera (if we would be able to solve TRANSACTION_OVERSIZE error )

# Note 
* this project's interigation with front-end  not completed due TRANSACTION_OVERSIZE error (The size of the Transaction is greater than transactionMaxBytes) , we tried a lot of way's to solve this but not able to solve this error,  code for backend is upto date and working fine,we also added a demo of over site so that you get an idea how does it will gona work's once we get success to deploy our contract on  hedera node . we just need to deploy our smart contract to Hedera  node . we used test net for testing it showing that how does it would work's if we would able to connect this backend to Hedera.
